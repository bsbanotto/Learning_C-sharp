This is a README file for the first sprint of C# projects

## Task 0. FizzBuzz - A classic place to start
Print integers 1 to 100.
 - If the integer is divisible by 3, print "Buzz"
 - If the integer is divisible by 5, print "Fizz"
 - If an integer is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"

## Task 1. Palindrome
Given a string, write a function that returns true if the string is a
palindrome, otherwise return false

## Task 2. Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers that sum
to the given target, otherwise return [-1, -1]
    Example:
    nums = [1, 3, 5, 8, 15]
    target = 13
    Returns: [2, 3]

## Task 3. Merge Two Sorted Lists
Given two sorted lists of integers, merge into a single sorted list
    Example:
    list1 = [1, 2, 4]
    list2 = [1, 3, 4]
    Returns: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4]

## Task 4. Move Zeroes
Given a list of integers, move all 0's to the end, while maintaining the
relative order
    Example:
    nums = [0, 3, 0, 1, 12]
    Returns: [3, 1, 12, 0, 0]
